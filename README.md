# Snake_Game
This is a classic Snake game built with Arduino and a TFT display, featuring increasingly challenging levels, barriers, and random food generation for the snake to consume. The snake grows with each "food" consumed, and the game ends when the snake collides with itself or a barrier.

# Features
 * Levels: Difficulty increases every 2 points, adding more obstacles as you progress.
 * Random Food Generation: Food appears in different locations, disappearing when eaten and reappearing elsewhere.
 * Barrier Mechanics: Static barriers add complexity, and collision with them ends the game.
 * Dynamic Speed Adjustment: The snakeâ€™s speed increases with each level.
 * Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score and level.

# How to Play
Control the snake's direction to consume food items and avoid hitting the barriers or the snake's own body. Each level introduces more challenges, making it progressively harder to survive.
