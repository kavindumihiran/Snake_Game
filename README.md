# Snake_Game
This is a classic Snake game built with Arduino and a TFT display, featuring increasingly challenging levels, barriers, and random food generation for the snake to consume. The snake grows with each "food" consumed, and the game ends when the snake collides with itself or a barrier.

# Features
 * Levels: Difficulty increases every 2 points, adding more obstacles as you progress.
 * Random Food Generation: Food appears in different locations, disappearing when eaten and reappearing elsewhere.
 * Barrier Mechanics: Static barriers add complexity, and collision with them ends the game.
 * Dynamic Speed Adjustment: The snake’s speed increases with each level.
 * Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score and level.

# How to Play
This is a classic Snake game, designed to run on an Arduino setup with a TFT display. To play:

 * Setup: Ensure you have an Arduino and a compatible TFT display. Connect the display to your Arduino as per the pin configurations in the code.
 * Upload Code: Download the files in this repository, open the main .ino file in the Arduino IDE, and upload it to your Arduino board.
 * Run: Once uploaded, the game will start on your TFT display. Use the directional controls to navigate the snake, consume food, and avoid barriers and self-collisions.
 * Gameplay: Control the snake’s direction to consume food items and grow. Avoid hitting the snake's body or barriers to keep the game going. Each new level increases the difficulty!
